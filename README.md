## Our Mission

At PotholePatrol, our mission is to enhance the road travel experience by ensuring timely and proactive road maintenance. By identifying road damages using AI, we aim to assist local governments and road authorities in prioritizing and addressing road repairs, thus reducing vehicle damage and promoting safer driving conditions.

## The Problem

Poor road conditions, especially potholes, are a significant concern for many reasons:

- **Safety Risks:** Potholes can lead to traffic accidents, causing injuries or even fatalities.
- **Vehicle Damage:** They can cause severe damage to vehicles, leading to expensive repairs.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Without early detection, potholes can grow larger, increasing the cost of repairs.

## Data Collection

To address this, we have collected a comprehensive dataset consisting of thousands of labeled images of roads, both damaged and undamaged, under various lighting and weather conditions.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Problem Definition:** Define the scope of road damages to be detected by the AI.
2. **Example Cases:** Collect and label images of roads with potholes, cracks, and other damages, as well as images of undamaged roads.
3. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess images for training, ensuring a balanced dataset for better generalization.
4. **Training AlexNet:** Utilize AlexNet's architecture, fine-tuned to recognize patterns indicative of road damage.
5. **Colab Notebook Development:** Develop and train the model using Google Colab for its GPU support.
6. **Weights & Biases Integration:** Monitor and log the training progress and performance using Weights & Biases for version control and experiment tracking.

## How It Works

PotholePatrol's AI model processes images from street cameras and identifies potential damages. Upon detection, the system geo-tags the location and sends an alert to the road maintenance dashboard. This facilitates a quick response for assessment and repair scheduling.

## Impact

By implementing PotholePatrol:

- Municipalities can optimize repair schedules and budgeting.
- Drivers experience safer roads and reduced vehicle repair costs.
- Insurance companies benefit from fewer claims related to road damage.
